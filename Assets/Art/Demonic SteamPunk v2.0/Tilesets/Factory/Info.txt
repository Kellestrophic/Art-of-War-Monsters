The window is 2x4 in 8x8 tiles, so 16x32 pixels. The background is meant to be built with a tileset of it's own.

The pipes are designed to fit into one another, one end is wider and the other is flat. When placed next to
each other, the effect of continuity is achieved.

The hanging ceiling lights were made longer than they need to be so that if your level ends up being tall, they could reach.
The light effect is also seperate so that you can play with lights flickering in a simple way.

The stone platform and railing are not meant to be tiled, but it's possible.

The treadmill has been animated to be moving to the right in two frames, but if you want to reverse it, just place frame 2 in front of frame 1.
